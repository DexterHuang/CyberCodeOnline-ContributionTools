HELLO FELLOW CONTRIBUTOR FROM CyberCode Online

To use this veeeeery small program, just launch the .html and open the dev console (F12 or Ctrl + Maj + I)

You can click on a case to switch its state

When youre happy of your work, just tap in the console : generateExportDiscord()

If you like to edit someone else's composition, tap in the console : importGeneratedDiscord(stringOfTheMap)
Be careful to remove newlines from the map

Have great contributions ^^
